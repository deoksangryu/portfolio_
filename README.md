# Deoksang Ryu - AI Developer Portfolio

## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

I'm passionate about creating novel user experiences by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal AI. My focus is on integrating AI into complex and dynamic environments like **Continuous Content Generator, LLM, Research Models and GUI Automation** to build innovative solutions.

My strength lies in translating cutting-edge AI concepts into practical, real-world applications using advanced techniques like RAG, Agents, and Procedural Content Generation.

## üéØ Core Competencies

- **LLM Integration** (90%): Expert in integrating Large Language Models into applications
- **Game Development** (85%): Experience with Unity and game AI systems
- **AI Agents** (90%): Building intelligent agents for automation and interaction
- **RAG Systems** (80%): Implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation for factual accuracy
- **GUI Automation** (85%): Creating intelligent automation using Vision-Language Models

## üöÄ Featured Projects

### 1. Dynamic Game NPC with EXAONE LLM
**Summary**: Integrates LG's EXAONE AI into a game engine to create lifelike NPCs that interact in real-time.

**Key Contributions**:
- Designed and developed the back-end system to integrate the Unity game engine with the LLM API
- Built a real-time communication pipeline to process player input and LLM responses
- Performed prompt engineering to ensure the LLM generated responses consistent with the NPC's character settings

**Technologies**: Unity, Python, LG EXAONE API, LLM, Game AI

### 2. LLM-based Game World Generator
**Summary**: An AI-powered PCG system that automatically generates a game's lore, regions, and NPC settings from a simple concept.

**Key Contributions**:
- Designed the system architecture for a PCG system using an LLM
- Structured and optimized prompts to generate consistent and compelling game settings
- Defined the data format (JSON) and implemented parsing logic to ensure the generated output could be used directly in a game engine

**Technologies**: Python, LLM, PCG, JSON

**GitHub**: [game-world-generator](https://github.com/deoksangryu/game-world-generator)

### 3. Intelligent GUI Agent using VLM
**Summary**: A GUI automation agent that understands natural language commands by using a VLM to see the screen and operate the mouse.

**Key Contributions**:
- Designed the screen analysis and interaction logic using a VLM (e.g., GPT-4o)
- Built a prompt system to translate natural language commands into tasks the VLM could understand
- Developed an automation module to connect the VLM's decisions to actual mouse and keyboard controls

**Technologies**: Python, VLM, GUI Automation, PyAutoGUI

**GitHub**: [gui-agent-with-vlm](https://github.com/deoksangryu/gui-agent-with-vlm)

### 4. TruthSync: Factual Accuracy for Gemma
**Summary**: Applies RAG to Google's Gemma model to minimize 'hallucinations' and increase the factual reliability of its answers.

**Key Contributions**:
- Designed and implemented the end-to-end RAG pipeline architecture
- Built a vector database and selected an embedding model for efficient information retrieval
- Conducted prompt engineering and fine-tuning experiments to enable the Gemma model to effectively utilize the retrieved external knowledge

**Technologies**: Python, Gemma, RAG, Vector Database, LLM Fine-tuning
